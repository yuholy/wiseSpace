# Guide

This guide is organized by task first, framework second. Start with the shortest path that matches what you are trying to do today.

## I Want To Get Something Working Quickly

- [Install by scenario](/guide/installation) for peer-dependency decisions and CSS order.
- [Quick Start](/guide/quick-start) for the smallest Vue 3 example.
- [Usage & Streaming](/guide/usage) if you need to choose between `content` and `nodes`.
- [Docs Site & VitePress](/guide/vitepress-docs-integration) if you are wiring stable Markdown pages, theme CSS, and custom tags inside a docs site.
- [AI Chat & Streaming](/guide/ai-chat-streaming) if the UI updates continuously and you need one guided path for peers, parsing, performance, and troubleshooting.
- [Troubleshooting by Symptom](/guide/troubleshooting-path) if you do not yet know whether the issue is CSS, peers, SSR, or custom-tag wiring.
- [Props & Options](/guide/props) if the renderer already works and you only need configuration.

## I Want To Customize Rendering

- [API Reference](/guide/api) for parser helpers, scoping, and render-pipeline entry points.
- [Renderer & Node Components](/guide/components) for exported renderer and node component reference.
- [Override Built-in Components](/guide/component-overrides) to replace `image`, `code_block`, `mermaid`, `link`, or other built-ins.
- [Custom Tags & Advanced Components](/guide/custom-components) to support trusted tags such as `thinking`.
- [Advanced Parser Hooks](/guide/advanced) and [Parser API](/guide/parser-api) for token or AST-level customization.

## I Want To Adopt It In An Existing App

- [Nuxt SSR](/nuxt-ssr) for browser-only peers and client-only guards.
- [AI / Skills workflows](/guide/ai-workflows) for copyable prompts, reusable checklists, and migration tasks.
- [Migrate from react-markdown](/guide/react-markdown-migration) and the [Migration Cookbook](/guide/react-markdown-migration-cookbook) for React teams.
- [Troubleshooting](/guide/troubleshooting) when the install works but styles, peers, or SSR do not.
