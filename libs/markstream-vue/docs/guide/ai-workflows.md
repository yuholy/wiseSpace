# AI / Skills Workflows

If you use Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or another coding assistant to adopt markstream, the fastest way to get useful output is to give the tool the right constraints up front.

This page is intentionally practical: copyable prompts, rollout checklists, and what a reusable markstream-focused skill should cover.

## Start with your goal

- Want packaged skills you can install right now: jump to [Install the packaged skills](#install-the-packaged-skills)
- Want ready-made prompt templates without cloning the repo: jump to [Copyable prompts](#2-copyable-prompts)
- Want to migrate from another renderer with an assistant: start with [Copyable prompts](#2-copyable-prompts) and the rollout pattern below
- Want to version reusable AI assets inside your own repo: read [Repository assets](#repository-assets)

## Install the packaged skills

For end users, the recommended command is the shared `skills` installer:

```bash
npx skills add Simon-He95/markstream-vue
```

That path works because the repository now publishes reusable skills under `.agents/skills`, which `npx skills` can discover directly from GitHub.

The Vercel `skills` installer also supports multiple source formats:

```bash
# GitHub shorthand (owner/repo)
npx skills add Simon-He95/markstream-vue

# Full GitHub URL
npx skills add https://github.com/Simon-He95/markstream-vue

# Direct path to one skill in this repo
npx skills add https://github.com/Simon-He95/markstream-vue/tree/main/.agents/skills/markstream-install

# Any git URL
npx skills add git@github.com:Simon-He95/markstream-vue.git
```

If you specifically want the package CLI, you can still use:

```bash
npx markstream-vue skills install
# or
pnpm dlx markstream-vue skills install
```

Useful variants:

```bash
npx markstream-vue skills list
npx markstream-vue skills install --target codex
npx markstream-vue skills install --target ./tmp/skills-test --mode copy --force
```

- `npx skills add Simon-He95/markstream-vue` is the primary recommendation for Codex-compatible skill installation
- `skills install` defaults to `copy`, which is safer for `npx` and `dlx` usage
- the default target is `~/.agents/skills`
- `--target codex` targets `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills`
- `--target` accepts either `agents`, `codex`, or any custom path
- `--force` replaces existing installs at the target path

The prompts stay in the repository under `prompts/`; the packaged installer only handles the skill folders.

The same CLI can also expose bundled prompt templates:

```bash
npx markstream-vue prompts list
npx markstream-vue prompts show install-markstream
```

That is usually the easiest way for npm users to discover the maintained prompt set without cloning the repository.

## Repository assets

This repository now includes reusable assets you can version with the codebase:

- Task skills: `markstream-install`, `markstream-custom-components`, `markstream-migration`
- Framework entry skills: `markstream-vue`, `markstream-nuxt`, `markstream-vue2`, `markstream-vue2-cli`, `markstream-vue2-vite`, `markstream-react`, `markstream-angular`
- `prompts/install-markstream.md`
- `prompts/override-built-in-components.md`
- `prompts/add-custom-tag-thinking.md`
- `prompts/migrate-react-markdown.md`
- `prompts/audit-markstream-integration.md`

Use `.agents/skills/` when you want reusable Codex workflow assets that GitHub-based installers can discover automatically. The task skills cover cross-framework work; the framework entry skills make Vue 3, Nuxt, Vue 2, Vue 2 CLI, Vue 2 Vite, React, and Angular scenarios directly discoverable. Use `prompts/` when you want copyable starting prompts for humans or other assistants.

## 1. Give the AI these five facts first

Before you ask for code changes, include:

- framework and version, for example Vue 3, Nuxt 3, React 18, or Angular 20
- CSS stack, for example Tailwind, UnoCSS, reset libraries, or a design system
- rendering mode: static article, docs site, SSR, or streaming chat
- required peers: Monaco, Mermaid, D2, KaTeX, or Shiki
- whether overrides must stay scoped to one area of the app

Without that context, assistants often install the wrong peers or place CSS in the wrong order.

## 2. Copyable prompts

### Install markstream in an existing Vue 3 app

```text
Install markstream-vue into this Vue 3 app.
Use the smallest peer-dependency set that matches these needs: [fill in Monaco / Mermaid / D2 / KaTeX / Shiki].
Keep CSS order safe with my existing stack: [fill in Tailwind / UnoCSS / reset library].
Add one minimal render example, and explain whether I should use `content` or `nodes`.
If you replace or override anything, keep it scoped with `custom-id`.
```

### Migrate from `react-markdown`

```text
Migrate this React codebase from react-markdown to markstream-react.
Audit which remark/rehype behaviors have no direct 1:1 equivalent.
Replace simple renderer overrides first, then call out anything that needs custom nodes, customHtmlTags, or parser/node post-processing.
Preserve existing user-visible behavior where practical.
```

### Add a custom tag such as `thinking`

```text
Add support for a trusted custom Markdown tag named `thinking`.
Use `customHtmlTags` plus a scoped `setCustomComponents` mapping.
Render nested Markdown inside the custom component, and keep the implementation streaming-friendly.
Do not use global overrides unless there is a clear reason.
```

### Debug styling or SSR issues

```text
Audit this markstream integration for CSS order, reset conflicts, optional peers, and SSR-only problems.
Check whether `markstream-vue/index.css` is loaded in the correct layer, whether KaTeX CSS is missing, and whether browser-only peers are gated behind client-only boundaries.
Explain the smallest fix set.
```

## 3. What a reusable markstream skill should do

If you are building a reusable prompt, template, or coding skill around markstream, it should reliably cover these steps:

- detect the framework and package manager
- install only the required peers for the requested features
- place CSS after resets and inside `@layer components` when utility frameworks are involved
- choose `content` for simple rendering and `nodes` plus `final` for streaming
- use `custom-id` for overrides by default
- point the user to the right docs page after making changes

Good follow-up links for a skill to cite:

- [Installation](/guide/installation)
- [Usage & Streaming](/guide/usage)
- [Override Built-in Components](/guide/component-overrides)
- [Custom Tags & Advanced Components](/guide/custom-components)
- [Troubleshooting](/guide/troubleshooting)

## 4. Point AI agents at the agent context file

For repository-aware assistants, also point them to:

- [AI / LLM context](/llms)

That file is agent-facing. This page is human-facing. In practice, the best results come from giving the assistant both:

- the task-specific prompt from this page
- the repository context file from `/llms`

## 5. A rollout pattern that works well

When the task is bigger than a one-file demo, ask the assistant to work in this order:

1. install and verify peers
2. make the base renderer work
3. fix CSS order
4. add scoped overrides or custom tags
5. run tests or docs build

That sequence prevents most “it compiled but looks wrong” outcomes.
