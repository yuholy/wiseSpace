## What wiseSpace Is

wiseSpace is a **local-first AI coding workspace** that brings coding, conversations, knowledge bases, skills, MCP, and file workflows into one desktop app.

It can act like a coding agent for reading and writing code, running commands, and analyzing projects, while also turning chats, documents, tool configuration, and execution context into a reusable personal knowledge system.

Instead of splitting chat, retrieval, tool use, and API routing across separate apps, wiseSpace is built around one continuous workflow: **ask, code, retrieve, execute, capture, and reuse** in the same context.

## What It Is For

- Using wiseSpace as an everyday AI workspace for software development, not just a chat window
- Preserving full conversation history, project context, and decision trails for later reuse
- Turning knowledge bases, memory, skills, and MCP into long-term personal leverage
- Using a local API gateway to unify models, CLI tools, and external workflows

## Core Direction

- **Coding First** — Designed for real development work with agent mode, code analysis, command execution, and project-level context
- **Workspace First** — Conversations, files, knowledge, memory, skills, and tools live in one workspace instead of scattered silos
- **Local First** — Local storage, local indexing, and a local gateway come first so data, performance, and portability stay under your control
- **Knowledge That Compounds** — Conversations, documents, tool configuration, and execution results become context for future work

- **Model Management** — Fetch remote model lists, customize parameters (temperature, max tokens, top-p, etc.)
- **Multi-Key Rotation** — Configure multiple API keys per provider with automatic rotation to distribute rate limit pressure
- **Streaming Output** — Real-time token-by-token rendering with collapsible thinking blocks
- **Message Versions** — Switch between multiple response versions per message to compare model or parameter effects
- **Conversation Branching** — Fork new branches from any message node, with side-by-side branch comparison
- **Conversation Management** — Pin, archive, time-grouped display, and bulk operations
- **Conversation Compression** — Automatically compress lengthy conversations, preserving key information to save context space
- **Multi-Model Simultaneous Response** — Ask the same question to multiple models at once, with side-by-side comparison of answers

### AI Agent

- **Agent Mode** — Switch to Agent mode for autonomous multi-step task execution: read/write files, run commands, analyze code, and more
- **Three Permission Levels** — Default (writes need approval), Accept Edits (auto-approve file changes), Full Access (no prompts) — safe and controllable
- **Working Directory Sandbox** — Agent operations are strictly confined to the specified working directory, preventing unauthorized access
- **Tool Approval Panel** — Real-time display of tool call requests with per-tool review, one-click "always allow", or deny
- **Cost Tracking** — Real-time token usage and cost statistics per session

### Content Rendering

- **Markdown Rendering** — Full support for code highlighting, LaTeX math formulas, tables, and task lists
- **Monaco Code Editor** — Embedded Monaco Editor in code blocks with syntax highlighting, copy, and diff preview
- **Diagram Rendering** — Built-in Mermaid flowchart and D2 architecture diagram rendering
- **Artifact Panel** — Code snippets, HTML drafts, Markdown notes, and reports viewable in a dedicated panel
- **Real-Time Voice Chat** — (Coming Soon) WebRTC-based real-time voice with OpenAI Realtime API support

### Search & Knowledge

- **Web Search** — Integrated with Tavily, Zhipu WebSearch, Bocha, and more, with citation source annotations
- **Local Knowledge Base (RAG)** — Supports multiple knowledge bases; upload documents for automatic parsing, chunking, and indexing, with semantic retrieval of relevant passages during conversations
- **Memory System** — Supports multi-namespace conversational memory, with manual entry or AI-powered auto-extraction (auto-extraction coming soon)
- **Context Management** — Flexibly attach file attachments, search results, knowledge base passages, memory entries, and tool outputs

## FAQ

### macOS: "App Is Damaged" or "Cannot Verify Developer"

Since the application is not signed by Apple, macOS may show one of the following prompts:

- "wiseSpace" is damaged and can't be opened
- "wiseSpace" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

**Steps to resolve:**

**1. Allow apps from "Anywhere"**

```bash
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Security** and select **Anywhere**.

**2. Remove the quarantine attribute**

```bash
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/wiseSpace.app
```

> Tip: You can drag the app icon onto the terminal after typing `sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine `.

**3. Additional step for macOS Ventura and later**

After completing the above steps, the first launch may still be blocked. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, then click **Open Anyway** in the Security section. This only needs to be done once.
